# War-of-Ages
Introduction
This is a tower defense game in which two players summon troops to attack the opposing players tower while defending their own. Gold is automatically accumulated over time, and is used to upgrade their troops and tower, improving their attacking and defending capabilities.

Purpose
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate a thorough understanding of fundamental programming concepts, including Object Oriented Programming, data structures, and algorithms both to manipulate information stored in various data structures as well as to operate game processes.

Setup
The image and audio files may need to be moved to the folder containing the main.java file depending on the configuration used to run the program. It's current state is that of a project exported from the Eclipse IDE, with the .java files found in the src folder.
